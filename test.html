<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them. </span>
<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as "first party cookies"), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third party cookies"). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted. </span>
<h3><b>How we use cookies</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the "like" or "follow" button on a post, for example).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered WordPress.com user (so you don’t have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below. </span>
<h3><b>Where we place cookies</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We set cookies in a number of different locations across our services. These include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, and akismet.com).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the administrative dashboards of our websites, such as Calypso and wp-admin.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On sites we host for our users.</span></li>
 	<li>On sites that use our plugins (e.g. Jetpack).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Types of Cookie</b></h3>

<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cookies are used to display relevant advertising to visitors who use our services or visit websites we host or provide, as well as to understand and report on the efficacy of ads served on our websites. They track details such as the number of unique visitors, the number of times particular ads have been displayed, and the number of clicks the ads have received. They are also used to build user profiles, including showing you ads based on products you’ve viewed or acts you have taken on our (and other) websites. These are set by Automattic and trusted third party networks, and are generally persistent in nature.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Party / Embedded Content</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sites hosted on WordPress.com make use of different third party applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors. These include social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons), or embedded content from Youtube and Vimeo. As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.</span></td>

<h3>User Sites</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the cookies set on our own sites, we utilize cookies for our </span><a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/stats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site Stats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature. This tallies the unique numbers of visitors to a site, as well as the number from specific geographic locations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A visitor is counted when we see a user or browser for the first time in a given period.</span>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are examples of the cookies set by Automattic, with explanations of their purpose. Some of these cookies are set across our whole network, whereas some are specific to individual services (e.g. WordPress.com, Longreads, etc). Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, but rather aims to be representative. Information about cookies that may be set by third parties, such as our ads partners, is below.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, people and companies that use our services to publish or host their own sites may place additional cookies. We provide more information on these cookies below.</span>

<b>Advertisements from Third Parties Through Automattic’s Ads Program</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission is to democratize publishing. So that we can offer free access to create a website using WordPress.com, we show ads on some of our users’ sites. Our users may also choose to place ads on their site through our ads program. Additionally, we also show ads from our ads program on some of our own websites (e.g. longreads.com).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We operate our ads program in partnership with third party vendors. As part of the operation of our ads program, we use cookies to collect certain information. Advertising cookies enable us and our partners to serve ads and to personalize those ads based on information like visits to our sites and other sites on the Internet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a representative list of our advertising program partners, along with information on the cookies that that each partner sets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partners we work with change from time to time, and this is not an exhaustive list.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that this section is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather aims to be representative, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that our users may set additional cookies (such as Google Analytics), depending on the features they have chosen to enable or the plugins they have installed.</span>
<h3>Controlling Cookies</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set. Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored – either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins. If you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org. For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising visit <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu">youronlinechoices.eu</a> (EU based) or <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info">optout.aboutads.info</a> (US based). On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit ad tracking.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s opt-out browser add-on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3>Our Internal Analytics Tool</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We call each one of these actions an “event.” Analytics events are attached to your WordPress.com account and are handled via a first party system that Automattic owns and maintains. In general, we record the following data for each event: IP address, WordPress.com user ID and username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (for sites not hosted on WordPress.com), user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We use this information to improve our products, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may opt out of our analytics program through your user settings. By doing so, you won’t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Note that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track - for example, if you publish a post, we will still have record of that (don’t worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool. </span>
<h3>Consent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may see a “cookie banner” on our websites and dashboards. If you are visiting one of our users' sites from the EU, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept. When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site you are visiting and on other of our websites, dashboards, and services. We’ll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.</span>
<h3><b>Consent and Choices for Advertisements on Our Users’ Sites Through Our Ads Program</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may see a “cookie banner” on our users’ websites, particularly if you are in the European Union. If so, then our ad program does not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you accept. When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set third party advertising cookies on our network in order to show you personalized ads. We’ll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">* Please note this consent feature will start on May 22, 2018.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We set a cookie to help us understand how visitors engage with websites that participate in our ad program. Visitors may opt out of our use of this information by </span><a href="https://s.pubmine.com/opt-out"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visiting this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the opt-out will be processed immediately with no confirmation step). When you opt out, we replace the unique value for that cookie with an opt-out value</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The opt-out works across all websites in our ads program. If you have opted out by accident, or wish to opt back in, you may do so by </span><a href="https://s.pubmine.com/opt-in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visiting this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Please note that this option is browser specific, and so if you use a different device or browser or clear your cookies, then you will need to repeat the process.</span>
<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about our use of cookies, you can find the most relevant contact details in our </span><a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
